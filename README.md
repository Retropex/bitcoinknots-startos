# Bitcoin Knots for StartOS

This project packages [Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) for StartOS.

By using Knots, you’re supporting a version of Bitcoin that prioritizes efficiency, security, and flexibility. With Bitcoin Knots’ enhanced configuration options, you can fine-tune your node to help keep the network clean and resilient, actively reducing unnecessary load from spam or parasitic transactions.

Every node strengthens the Bitcoin network, and your decision to use Bitcoin Knots contributes directly to a more decentralized and spam-resistant ecosystem. Your node not only validates and secures transactions but also sets an example for a more sustainable, user-focused Bitcoin network.

Welcome to the community of Bitcoin Knots users, and thank you for helping Bitcoin grow stronger!

## Cloning

Clone the project locally. Note the submodule link to the original project(s). 

```
git clone https://github.com/Retropex/knots-startos.git
cd knots-startos
git submodule update --init
```

## Building

To build the project for all supported platforms, run the following command:

```
make
```

To build the project for a single platform, run:

```
# for amd64
make x86
```
or
```
# for arm64
make arm
```

## Installing (on Start9 server)

Run the following commands to determine successful install:
> :information_source: Change server-name.local to your Start9 server address

```
start-cli auth login
# Enter your StartOS password
start-cli --host https://server-name.local package install bitcoind.s9pk
```

If you already have your `start-cli` config file setup with a default `host`, you can install simply by running:

```
make install
```

> **Tip:** You can also install the `bitcoind.s9pk` using **Sideload Service** under the **System > Manage** section.
